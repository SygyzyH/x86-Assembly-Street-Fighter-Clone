# x86-Assembly-Street-Fighter-Clone
A project I did a long time ago. This is written for DOS-BOX v0.74-2, for anyone intereseted in running it. The graphics are, of course, not mine.

## Running instructions
In order to run this, you will need some sort of emulator. As stated before, I used DOS-BOX. After mounting your drive and navigating to the folder where you downloaded this project (instructions to mounting drives can be found in the DOS-BOX website), you will need to first compile, link and than run the program, using the turbo assembly executable, and the turbo linker executable. My copies of these files can be found in the "installation" folder.

To run the script, type:
```
tasm /zi str
tlink /v str
str
```
